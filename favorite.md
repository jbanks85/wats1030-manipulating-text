After working with all of the text editors, I actually found myself more at home in Vim. The commands, though plenty, were easier for me to remember than emacs of nano commands. It's nice to have two modes like command and insert, which helps in preventing getting off track. Having you location displayed where you're at within the content is helpful and the search functions were more in depth, though slightly more complicated. I'll probably get to learning Vim more than the other two but the commands in Vim and emac tend to overlap so I'll probably test out both.
